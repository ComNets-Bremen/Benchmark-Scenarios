# Benchmark-Scenarios
This repository contains information about the Benchmark-Scenarios designed for OPS framework in OmNet++.

The 'Benchmark_Scenarios.pdf' contains descriptive information about all the developed scenarios including descriptions about mobility traces and traffic traces.

Inside the 'Scenarios' folder all the scenarios are available in CSV format. Here mainly mobilty trace and the traffic generation traces are included. All other scenarios include a folder names 'Trace' which includes the mobility trace file. Some of the scenarios are developed with contact traces and some with location traces. Please note that: The mobilty trace for the Taxi scenario is not included in this repository due to its large size.

Except Typhoon scenarion all other scenarios include two hand crafted traffic traces (High and Low traffic). Since traffic generation pattern for Typhoon scenario is designed with the original dataset from 'Twitter' it only contains one traffic trace. 

The 'Results' folder contains the obtained results for more than 30 different metrics including following with different forwarding protocols.  
1.Average Hop Count  
2.Delivery Ratio  
3.Average Delivery Delay  
4.Total Bytes Sent  
5.Average Contact Duration  
6.Average Neighbouhood Size  
7.Total Contact Count
